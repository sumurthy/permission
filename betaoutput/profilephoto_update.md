# Update profilephoto

> **Important**: APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Update the photo for any user in the tenant including the signed-in user, or the specified group or contact. Since there
is currently a limit of 4MB on the total size of each REST request, this limits the size of the photo
you can add to under 4MB.

Use only PUT for this operation in the beta version.

> **Note** The update photo operation in beta supports only the user's work or school mailboxes and not personal mailboxes.

## Prerequisites
One of the following **scopes** is required to execute this API for:

-	Profile photo of the signed-in **user** - *User.ReadWrite*, *User.ReadWrite.All*
- Profile photo of a **group** - *Group.ReadWrite.All*
- Photo of a **contact** - *Contacts.ReadWrite*

> **Note** To update the photo of any user in the organization, your app must have the User.ReadWrite.All application permission and call this API under its own identity, not on behalf of a user. To learn more, see [get access without a signed-in user](../../../concepts/auth_v2_service.md).
