# Get directory objects from a list of ids

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Returns the directory objects specified in a list of ids.  NOTE: The directory objects returned are the full objects containing **all** their properties. The `$select` query option is not available for this operation.

Some common uses for this function are to:

* Resolve ids returned by functions (that return collections of ids) such as [getMemberObjects](directoryobject_getmemberobjects.md) or [getMemberGroups](directoryobject_getmembergroups.md)  to their backing directory objects.
* Resolve ids persisted in an external store by the application to their backing directory objects.
