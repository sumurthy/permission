Since the **organization** resource supports [extensions](../../../concepts/extensibility_overview.md), you can use the `PATCH` operation to 
add, update, or delete your own app-specific data in custom properties of an extension in an existing **organization** instance.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and updated [organization](../resources/organization.md) object in the response body.
