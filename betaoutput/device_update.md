> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Update the properties of a device.
## Permissions
One of the following permissions is required to call this API. To learn more, including how to choose permissions, see [Permissions](../../../concepts/permissions_reference.md).


|Permission type      | Permissions (from least to most privileged)              |
|:--------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------|
|Delegated (work or school account) | Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All    |
|Delegated (personal Microsoft account) | Not supported.    |
|Application | Device.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All |

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
PATCH /devices/{id}
```
## Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description|
|:-----------|:------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body
In the request body, supply the values for relevant fields that should be updated. Existing properties that are not included in the request body will maintain their previous values or be recalculated based on changes to other property values. For best performance you shouldn't include existing values that haven't changed.

| Property	   | Type	|Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
|accountEnabled|Boolean| **true** if the account is enabled; otherwise, **false**. |
|alternativeSecurityIds|[alternativeSecurityId](../resources/alternativesecurityid.md) collection| The **any** operator is required for filter expressions on multi-valued properties. Not nullable.           |
|approximateLastSignInDateTime|DateTimeOffset|            The Timestamp type represents date and time information using ISO 8601 format and is always in UTC time. For example, midnight UTC on Jan 1, 2014 would look like this: `'2014-01-01T00:00:00Z'`|
|deviceId|Guid|            |
|deviceMetadata|String||
|operatingSystem|String|The type of operating system on the device.|
|operatingSystemVersion|String|The version of the operating system on the device|
|deviceVersion|Int32|            |
|physicalIds|String collection| Not nullable.            |
|trustType|String||
|displayName|String|The display name for the device.|
|isCompliant|Boolean|**true** if the device complies with Mobile Device Management (MDM) policies; otherwise, **false**.|
|isManaged|Boolean|**true** if the device is managed by a Mobile Device Management (MDM) app such as Intune; otherwise, **false**.|

Since the **device** resource supports [extensions](../../../concepts/extensibility_overview.md), you can use the `PATCH` operation to 
add, update, or delete your own app-specific data in custom properties of an extension in an existing **device** instance.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and updated [device](../resources/device.md) object in the response body.
