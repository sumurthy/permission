Retrieve the properties and relationships of a [Drive](../resources/drive.md) resource. A Drive is the top-level container for a file system. The Microsoft Graph API allows you to access the Drive resource for a user's OneDrive or OneDrive for Business, or SharePoint document libraries.

## Prerequisites

* Files.Read
* Files.ReadWrite
* Files.Read.All
* Files.ReadWrite.All
* Sites.Read.All
* Sites.ReadWrite.All

## Get a user's OneDrive

To access a user's OneDrive or OneDrive for Business, your app should request the **drive** relationship on the [User](../resources/user.md) resource.

## HTTP request

```http
GET /me/drive
GET /users/{idOrUserPrincipalName}/drive
```

## Get the document library assocaited with a group

To access a [Group's](../resources/group.md) default document library, your app requests the **drive** relationship on the Group.

```http
GET /groups/{idOrUserPrincipalName}/drive
```
