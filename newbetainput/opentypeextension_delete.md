# Delete open extension

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Delete an open extension ([openTypeExtension](../resources/openTypeExtension.md) object) from the specified instance of a resource. 

## Prerequisites

One of the following **permissions** is required to execute this API, depending on the resource you're
deleting the extension from:

|**Supported resource**|**Permission**|**Supported resource**|**Permission** |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| [administrativeunit](../resources/administrativeunit.md) | _Directory.AccessAsUser.All_ | [device](../resources/device.md) | _Device.ReadWrite.All_ |
| [event](../resources/event.md) | _Calendars.ReadWrite_ | [group](../resources/group.md) | _Group.ReadWrite.All_ |
| [group event](../resources/event.md) | _Group.ReadWrite.All_ | [group post](../resources/post.md) | _Group.ReadWrite.All_ |
| [message](../resources/message.md) | _Mail.ReadWrite_ | [organization](../resources/organization.md) | _Directory.AccessAsUser.All_ |
| [personal contact](../resources/contact.md) | _Contacts.ReadWrite_ | [user](../resources/user.md) | _Directory.AccessAsUser.All_ |

## HTTP request

In the request, identify the resource instance, use the **extensions** 
navigation property of that instance to identify the extension, and do a `DELETE` on that extension instance.

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
DELETE /administrativeUnits/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /devices/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/events/{id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /groups/{id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /groups/{id}/events/{id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /groups/{id}/threads/{id}/posts/{id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/messages/{id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /organization/{Id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/contacts/{id}/extensions/{extensionId}
DELETE /users/{id|userPrincipalName}/extensions/{extensionId}
```

>**Note:** The above syntax shows some common ways to identify a resource instance, in order to delete an extension from it. 
All other syntax that allows you to identify these resource instances supports deleting open extensions from them in a similar way.
