# domain: forceDelete

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Deletes a domain using an asynchronous operation.

The following actions are performed as part of this operation:

* Renames the UPN, EmailAddress, and ProxyAddress of users with references to the deleted domain.

* Renames the EmailAddress of groups with references to the deleted domain.

* Renames the identifierUris of applications with references to the deleted domain.

* If the number of objects to be renamed is greater than 100, an error is returned.

* If one of the applications to be renamed is a multi-tenant app, an error is returned.

After the domain deletion completes, API operations for the deleted domain will return a 404 HTTP response code. To verify deletion of a domain, you can perform a [get domain](domain_get.md). If the domain was successfully deleted, a 404 HTTP response code will be returned in the response.
