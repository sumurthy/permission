# Create device

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Create a new device.
## Prerequisites
One of the following **scopes** is required to execute this API: *Directory.ReadWrite.All* or *Directory.AccessAsUser.All*

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /devices

```
## Request headers
| Name       | Type | Description|
|:---------------|:--------|:----------|
| Authorization  | string  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of [device](../resources/device.md) object.

Since the **device** resource supports [extensions](../../../concepts/extensibility_overview.md), you can use the `POST` operation and add custom properties with your own data to the device instance while creating it.

## Response

If successful, this method returns `201, Created` response code and [device](../resources/device.md) object in the response body.
