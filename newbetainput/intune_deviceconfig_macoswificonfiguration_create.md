> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

> **Note:** Using the Microsoft Graph APIs to configure Intune controls and policies still requires that the Intune service is [correctly licensed](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=839381) by the customer.

Create a new [macOSWiFiConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_macoswificonfiguration.md) object.
## Prerequisites
One of the following [permission scopes](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/docs/authorization/permission_scopes) is required to execute this API:

*DeviceManagementConfiguration.ReadWrite.All*
## HTTP Request
<!-- {
  "blockType": "ignored"
}
-->
```http
POST /deviceManagement/deviceConfigurations
```

## Request headers
|Header|Value|
|---|---|
|Authorization|Bearer &lt;token&gt; Required.|
|Accept|application/json|

## Request body
In the request body, supply a JSON representation of a macOSWiFiConfiguration object.
The following table shows the properties that are required when you create a macOSWiFiConfiguration.

|Property|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|id|String|Key of the entity. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_deviceconfiguration.md)|
|lastModifiedDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was last modified. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_deviceconfiguration.md)|
|assignmentStatus|String|Read-only. DateTime the object was last modified. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_deviceconfiguration.md)|
|assignmentProgress|String|Read-only. DateTime the object was last modified. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_deviceconfiguration.md)|
|assignmentErrorMessage|String|Read-only. DateTime the object was last modified. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_deviceconfiguration.md)|
|createdDateTime|DateTimeOffset|DateTime the object was created. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_deviceconfiguration.md)|
|description|String|Admin provided description of the Device Configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_deviceconfiguration.md)|
|displayName|String|Admin provided name of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_deviceconfiguration.md)|
|version|Int32|Version of the device configuration. Inherited from [deviceConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_deviceconfiguration.md)|
|networkName|String|Network Name|
|ssid|String|This is the name of the Wi-Fi network that is broadcast to all devices.|
|connectAutomatically|Boolean|Connect automatically when this network is in range. Setting this to true will skip the user prompt and automatically connect the device to Wi-Fi network.|
|connectWhenNetworkNameIsHidden|Boolean|Connect when the network is not broadcasting its name (SSID). When set to true, this profile forces the device to connect to a network that doesn't broadcast its SSID to all devices.|
|wiFiSecurityType|String|Indicates whether Wi-Fi endpoint uses an EAP based security type. Possible values are: `open`, `wpaPersonal`, `wpaEnterprise`, `wep`.|
|proxySettings|String|Proxy Type for this Wi-Fi connection Possible values are: `none`, `manual`, `automatic`.|
|proxyManualAddress|String|IP Address or DNS hostname of the proxy server when manual configuration is selected.|
|proxyManualPort|Int32|Port of the proxy server when manual configuration is selected.|
|proxyAutomaticConfigurationUrl|String|URL of the proxy server automatic configuration script when automatic configuration is selected. This URL is typically the location of PAC (Proxy Auto Configuration) file.|
|preSharedKey|String|This is the pre-shared key for WPA Personal Wi-Fi network.|

## Response
If successful, this method returns a `201 Created` response code and a [macOSWiFiConfiguration](../resources/intune_deviceconfig_macoswificonfiguration.md) object in the response body.
