# group: checkMemberGroups

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Check for membership in the specified list of groups. Returns from the list those groups of which 
the specified group has a direct or transitive membership. 

You can check up to a maximum of 20 groups per request. This function supports Office 365 and other 
types of groups provisioned in Azure AD. Note that Office 365 Groups cannot contain groups. So membership 
in an Office 365 Group is always direct.
