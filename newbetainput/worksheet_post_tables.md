# Create Table

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Use this API to create a new Table.
## Prerequisites
The following **scopes** are required to execute this API: 

    * Files.ReadWrite

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
POST /workbook/worksheets/{id|name}/tables/add

```
## Request headers
| Name       | Description|
|:---------------|:----------|
| Authorization  | Bearer {token}. Required. |

## Request body
In the request body, supply following parameters. 

### Request parameters
| Name       | Type|Description|
|:---------------|:----------|
| Address  | string| Range address. If you are calling this API off of `worksheets/{id|name}/tables/add` path, there is no need to support the sheet name prefix in the address. However, if you are calling this off of `workbook/tables/add` path, then supply the sheet name on which the table needs to be created (example: `sheet1!A1:D4`)|
| hasHeaders  | boolean|Boolean value that indicates whether the range has column labels. If the source does not contain headers (i.e,. when this property set to false), Excel will automatically generate header shifting the data down by one row.|

## Response

If successful, this method returns `201, Created` response code and [Table](../resources/table.md) object in the response body.
