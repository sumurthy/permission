# Update subscription

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Renew a subscription by extending its expiry time.

Subscriptions to resources expire at dates proscribed by the individual resource types.  In order not to miss notifications, subscriptions should be renewed well in advance of their expiry date.  See [subscription](../resources/subscription.md) for individual expiry dates.
## Prerequisites

The following table lists the suggested permission needed for each resource.

| Resource type / Item        | Scope               |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| Contacts                    | Contacts.Read       |
| Conversations               | Group.Read.All      |
| Events                      | Calendars.Read      |
| Messages                    | Mail.Read           |
| Groups                      | Group.Read.All      |
| Users                       | User.Read.All       |
| Drive  (User's OneDrive)    | Files.ReadWrite     |
| Drives (Sharepoint shared content and drives) | Files.ReadWrite.All |

***Note:*** The /beta endpoint allows application permissions for most resources. Conversations in a Group and OneDrive drive root items are not supported with Application permissions.
