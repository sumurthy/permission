# Download the contents of a DriveItem

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Download the contents for a driveItem.
Only driveItem with the **file** property can be downloaded.

## Prerequisites
One of the following **scopes** is required to execute this API:

* Files.Read
* Files.ReadWrite
* Files.Read.All
* Files.ReadWrite.All
* Sites.Read.All
* Sites.ReadWrite.All

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/drive/root:/{item-path}:/content
GET /me/drive/items/{item-id}/content
GET /drives/items/{item-id}/content
GET /groups/{group-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/content
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Value  | Description                                                                                                                                              |
|:--------------|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| if-none-match | String | If this request header is included and the eTag (or cTag) provided matches the current tag on the file, an `HTTP 304 Not Modified` response is returned. |

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Example
Here is an example of how to call this API.


<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "driveitem-download-contents" } -->
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/drive/items/{item-id}/content
```

##### Response
Returns a `302 Found` response redirecting to a pre-authenticated download URL for the file.
This is the same URL available through the `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl` property on the DriveItem.

To download the contents of the file your application will need to follow the `Location` header in the response.
Many HTTP client libraries will automatically follow the 302 redirection and start downloading the file immedately.

Pre-authenticated download URLs are only valid for a short period of time (a few minutes) and do not require an `Authorization` header to download.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "stream" } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://b0mpua-by3301.files.1drv.com/y23vmagahszhxzlcvhasdhasghasodfi
```

## Partial range downloads

To download a partial range of bytes from the file, your app can use the `Range` header as specified in [RFC 2616](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt). 
Note that you must append the `Range` header to the actual `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl` URL and not to the request for `/content`.

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "driveitem-get-partial-content" } -->
```http
GET https://b0mpua-by3301.files.1drv.com/y23vmag
Range: bytes=0-1023
```

This will return an `HTTP 206 Partial Content` response with the request range of bytes from the file.
If the range cannot be generated the Range header may be ignored and an `HTTP 200` response would be returned with the full contents of the file.

<!-- { "blockType": "response", "@odata.type": "stream" } -->
```http
HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
Content-Range: bytes 0-1023/2048

<first 1024 bytes of file>
```
