# List items shared with the signed-in user

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Retrieve a collection of [DriveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) resources that have been shared with the owner of the [Drive](../resources/drive.md).

## Prerequisites
One of the following **scopes** is required to execute this API:

* Files.Read.All
* Files.ReadWrite.All
* Sites.Read.All
* Sites.ReadWrite.All

**Note:** while the /sharedWithMe request will succeed with Files.Read or Files.ReadWrite scopes, some properties may be missing.
Additionally, without one of the  **All** scopes, shared items returned from this API will not be accessible.

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```
GET /me/drive/sharedWithMe
```

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Example

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "drive-sharedwithme", "scopes": "files.read" } -->
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/drive/sharedWithMe
```

## Response

This returns a collection of [DriveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) resources which contain the DriveItem resources shared with the owner of the drive.
In this example, since the drive is the user's default drive, this returns items shared with the signed in user.

        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Remarks

DriveItems returned from the **sharedWithMe** action will always include the [**remoteItem**](../resources/remoteitem.md) facet which indicates they are items from a different drive. 
To access the shared DriveItem resource, you will need to make a request using the information provided in **remoteItem** in the following format:

<!-- {"blockType": "ignored"} -->
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/drives/{remoteItem.parentReference.driveId}/items/{remoteItem.id}
```
