# Delete permission

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Remove access to a [DriveItem](../resources/driveitem.md).

Only permissions that are not inherited can be deleted.
The **inheritedFrom** property must be `null`.

## Prerequisites
One of the following **scopes** is required to execute this API:

* Files.ReadWrite
* Files.ReadWrite.All
* Sites.ReadWrite.All

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
DELETE /me/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions/{perm-id}
DELETE /me/drive/root:/{path}:/permissions/{perm-id}
DELETE /groups/{group-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions/{perm-id}
DELETE /drives/{drive-id}/items/{item-id}/permissions/{perm-id}
```
