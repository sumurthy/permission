# List permissions on a DriveItem

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

List the effective permissions of on a [DriveItem](../resources/driveitem.md).

The **permissions** relationship of DriveItem cannot be expanded as part of a call to [get DriveItem](item_get.md) or a collection of DriveItems.
You must access the permissions property directly.

## Access to permissions

The permissions collection includes potentially sensitive information and may not be available for every caller.

* For the owner of the item, all permissions will be returned. 
  This includes co-owners.
* For a non-owner caller, only the permissions that apply to the caller are returned.
* Permission properties that contain secrets (e.g. `shareId` and `webUrl`) are only returned for callers that are able to create the Permission.

## Prerequisites
One of the following **scopes** is required to execute this API:

* Files.Read
* Files.ReadWrite
* Files.Read.All
* Files.ReadWrite.All
* Sites.Read.All
* Sites.ReadWrite.All

## HTTP request
<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```http
GET /me/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions
GET /me/drive/root:/{path}:/permissions
GET /drives/{drive-id}/items/{item-id}/permissions
GET /groups/{group-id}/drive/items/{item-id}/permissions
```

## Request headers

| Name          | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                     |
|:--------------|:-------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| if-none-match | string | If this request header is included and the etag provided matches the current etag on the item, an `HTTP 304 Not Modified` response is returned. |

## Optional query parameters

This method supports the `$expand`, `$select`, `$skipToken`, `$top`, and `$orderby` [OData query parameters](../../../concepts/query_parameters.md) to customize the response.

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Response

If successful, this method returns a `200 OK` response code and collection of [Permission](../resources/permission.md) resources in the response body.

Effective permissions of an item can come from two sources:

* Permissions applied directly on the item itself
* Permissions inherited from the item's ancestors

Callers can differentiate if the permission is inherited or not by checking the **inheritedFrom** property.
This property is an [**itemReference**](../resources/itemreference.md) resource referencing the ancestor that the permission is inherited from.
