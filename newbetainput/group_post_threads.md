# Create conversation thread

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

Start a new group conversation by first creating a thread. 

A new conversation, conversation thread, and post are created in the group. 
Use [reply thread](conversationthread_reply.md) or [reply post](post_reply.md) to further post to that thread.

Note: You can also [start a new thread in an existing conversation](conversation_post_threads.md).
