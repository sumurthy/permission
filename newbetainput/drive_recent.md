# List recent files

> **Important:** APIs under the /beta version in Microsoft Graph are in preview and are subject to change. Use of these APIs in production applications is not supported.

List a set of items that have been recently used by the signed in user.
This collection includes items that are in the user's drive as well as items they have access to from other drives.

## Prerequisites
One of the following **scopes** is required to execute this API:

* Files.Read
* Files.ReadWrite
* Files.Read.All
* Files.ReadWrite.All
* Sites.Read.All
* Sites.ReadWrite.All

## HTTP request

<!-- { "blockType": "ignored" } -->
```
GET /me/drive/recent
```

## Request body
Do not supply a request body for this method.

## Example

<!-- { "blockType": "request", "name": "drive-recent", "scopes": "files.read" } -->
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/me/drive/recent
```

## Response

This returns a collection of [DriveItem](../resources/driveitem.md) resources for items which the owner of the drive has recently accessed.
Items outside of the user's drive will include the [RemoteItem](../resources/remoteitem.md) facet, which provides information to access the shared item.

    }
  ]
}
```

## Remarks

Some driveItems returned from the **recent** action will include the **remoteItem** facet which indicates they are items from another drive. 
To access the original driveItem object, you will need to make a request using the information provided in **remoteItem** in the following format:

<!-- {"blockType": "ignored"} -->
```http
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/drives/{remoteItem.driveId}/items/{remoteItem.id}
```
