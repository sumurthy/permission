# Upload or replace the contents of a driveItem

The simple upload API allows you to provide the contents of a new file or update the contents of an existing file in a single API call. 
This method only supports files up to 4MB in size.

To upload large files see [Upload large files with an upload session](item_createUploadSession.md).
